# Cache-Explorer

This gem was created back in the days of the wonderful turntable.fm website. This would scrape the Chrome (I think) cache folder to find all of the songs from Turntable, use the ID3 tags to rename the files, and then save them to a better location. This was great because Turntable wound up being a great place for new dubstep artists to debut their jams and I didn't really know of any other way to obtain those.
